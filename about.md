## A step towards serenity


We aim to provide you with a guide towards a life filled with peacfuly serenity.  You and I surely know that the struggles of daily life and the internal battles within our own selves can stretch beyound our abilities to deal with them.  Some of us reach out for someone to lighten the burdens of our daily life, while some of us reach for an external serum to numb our senses with the hope of winning the battle with our conflicted self.  A self filled with depression, anxiety and lack of self-worth will take a toll even on the strongest of us.

Unfortantely, when all attempts at attaining happiness fail, some of us choose to completely part ways with this life, in hope of either a cessation of the pain or in hopes of a better after life.  You will find out from reading the words of our creator delivered to us in his holy book, The Quran, that the only relief from such a life is to turn to Him for guidance and to return to Him for eternal peace that starts in this life and extends to the after life.

What do you have to lose?  Read it, reflect on its words, and contemplate on the benefits to your aching soul in this life; and prechance, you might find your key to serenity.

I wish you a happy journey...
